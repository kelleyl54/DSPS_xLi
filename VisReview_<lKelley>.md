Review:

Hello Xiaolong,

This plot has many dimensions, yet I do not feel lost when looking at it, good job! Visually, there are no conflicting elements, an each variable is appropriately assigned its graphical element in a clear fashion. A few suggestions:
-	The size of each data point needs to relate to some scale. Currently, I don’t know what percentage corresponds to what size circle.
-	The horizontal and vertical axes need units. I’m not quite sure how these values are measured, but I assume it is some sort of ratio.
-	Finally, this visualization does not make a distinction between the categories of wine it plots, which I feel is an important dimension for this particular data set. Another graphical element which distinguishes this feature may be appropriate.

I appreciate the use of a uniform color scale. It makes this visualization easier on the eyes and lessens distraction. The scales on the axes are also responsibly chosen. They cover the whole data set without including unnecessary values outside those taken by the data. Your visualization does not lie with the data, it presents an accurate picture. Overall, an impressive job with your visualization of this many-faceted data set.

# FBB good suggestions. 

the review is well throught out and well argued. It should have been uploaded to the folded HW8 but ok
